* Things I needed to add:
** sudo apt install python3-yaml-dbg python3-pyqt5
* Changes to make
** file layout
Make a dummy handin root point 'hroot' somewhere; this would be the
equivalent of /home/handin if we went that way
HANDINHOME = /home/healyp/handin
*** codebase
Source code goes in $HANDINHOME/src
SRCDIR = $HANDINHOME/src
*** root point of all submissions
ROOTDIR = $HANDINHOME/.handin
*** modules, the main stuff
For each module that has ever been set up; all rooted under $ROOTDIR.  We
would expect to see here simply module names and underneath that yearly
(semesterly) iterations of that module

**** iterations e.g. AY2020-2021-S2 for a specific module
 - student assessments
 - class lists
 - definitions
 - log file
 - 

** So a typical installation would have
   $HANDINHOME/src # == $SRCDIR
   $ROOTDIR/cs4115/AY2019-2020-S2/...
   $ROOTDIR/cs4115/AY2020-2021-S2/class-list
   $ROOTDIR/cs4115/AY2020-2021-S2/logfile
   $ROOTDIR/cs4115/AY2020-2021-S2/w03
