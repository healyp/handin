# TODO
The following file outlines what is left to be done with the system (that I could think of!)

- Functionality for a student to query the server for submissions. This could be done by:
    - Sending an e-mail after submission
    - Saving a confirmation to the student's disk
    - Adding a -q option to the students script to allow them to query the server
    
- system_server at the moment, compares output and answer file by removing punctuation and then checking equality.
Should it be using diff instead?
- Module code presently is specific to the UL CSIS module Codes and can only be along the lines of CS1234
- The system call monitoring needs to be improved
- Gap weeks may still be an issue
- Manual Execution functionality for tests- a way to specify that a test is to be executed manually.
Used for stuff like graphics inspection etc.
