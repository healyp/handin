        <h1>Welcome to Handin File Server!</h1>
        <p>If you are seeing this, it is because you accessed the server through a browser and not a handin client</p>
        <p>The server is used to provide handin clients with access to files in the .handin directory on the server
          hosting it. It allows for authentication, resource retrieval and creation (such as modules, assignments etc.).
          It provides a centralised location for all the data that clients can then access from different locations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is not intended to be accessed by a browser with a HTTP request and as such, does not have any front-end to it, with the exception
          of this information message of course!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The following clients can be used to access this server:</p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">python3 src/h4l.py (This script needs lecturer <b>authentication</b>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These commands needs to be run from handin directory (place you downloaded handin)</p>
